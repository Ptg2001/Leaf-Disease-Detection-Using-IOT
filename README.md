# Abstract
Leaf disease prompt identification and 
surveillance in today's agricultural landscape is the key to 
preserving crop vitality and obtaining high yields. To overcome 
this obstacle, we put forward a novel solution with state-of-theart deep learning techniques to transform leaf disease detection 
in smart agriculture. Reusing Raspberry Pi as the platform for
processing and implementing advanced CNNs on the edge-our 
system provides prompt and accurate leaf image analysis in the 
field. The benefit of our site analysis is twofold, it maximizes 
speed while retaining bandwidth all of which culminates in 
getting farmers immediately updated on the situation of their 
crop health. Using comprehensive and accurate testing and 
verification, we show the high efficiency of our method in the 
quick recognition of current leaf diseases. This provides for 
preventive disease control measures thus improving overall 
agricultural efficiency. The convergence of deep learning drives 
a new era of intelligent farming where data-driven decisions and 
advanced cultivation techniques match to establish smart and 
adaptive food production systems.

# Goals and Objectives
To determine the efficiency of incorporating 
Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera technology in diagnosing plant 
diseases using smart agriculture.
• Evaluation of a variety of pre-established machine 
learning and deep learning models to identify plant diseases 
and analyze performance indicators like accuracy, loss, 
precision, and F1 score.
• To select an optimal model and investigate the 
feasibility of the merger of Raspberry Pi and machine 
learning techniques for fast and precise diagnosis of disease 
in agricultural environments and prospective uses of the 
developed system in prompt disease detection and soil.
• To enhance such agricultural practices through our 
suggestion of cost-effective and reachable disease diagnosis 
systems.
• To monitor crops using various sensors such as soil 
moisture, humidity, temperature, etc.
