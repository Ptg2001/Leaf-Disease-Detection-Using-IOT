#Abstract
Leaf disease prompt identification and 
surveillance in today's agricultural landscape is the key to 
preserving crop vitality and obtaining high yields. To overcome 
this obstacle, we put forward a novel solution with state-of-theart deep learning techniques to transform leaf disease detection 
in smart agriculture. Reusing Raspberry Pi as the platform for
processing and implementing advanced CNNs on the edge-our 
system provides prompt and accurate leaf image analysis in the 
field. The benefit of our site analysis is twofold, it maximizes 
speed while retaining bandwidth all of which culminates in 
getting farmers immediately updated on the situation of their 
crop health. Using comprehensive and accurate testing and 
verification, we show the high efficiency of our method in the 
quick recognition of current leaf diseases. This provides for 
preventive disease control measures thus improving overall 
agricultural efficiency. The convergence of deep learning drives 
a new era of intelligent farming where data-driven decisions and 
advanced cultivation techniques match to establish smart and 
adaptive food production systems.
